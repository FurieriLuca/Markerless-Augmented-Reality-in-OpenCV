# The "CVLAB" logo and the author "Pietro Azzari" are added as an augmented layer, which is not present in the real video. A RANSAC estimator is used to identify the most important feature points, which are then used to compute the homography which projects the augmented layer on the book cover. The algorithm tracks the changes in the light of the scene to alter the color of the augmented color to achieve a realistic effect.
